                <p>Free is a company founded by Xavier Niel, which revolutionized the telecommunications sector in France.
                On January 10, 2012, Xavier Niel held a conference on the Champs-Élysées to present the launch of Free Mobile.
                During this event, he highlighted the advantages of Free Mobile by comparing them to those of its competitors.
                He unveiled a groundbreaking offer, with no contract, including unlimited calls, texts, and MMS, as well as mobile internet access, all for only €19.99.
                At the time, similar plans cost around €80, which was nearly 4.3 times more expensive than Free’s offer.
                Xavier Niel also introduced a second, more affordable plan that included 1 hour of calls and unlimited texts.

                By May 2012, just a few months after its launch, Free Mobile had already attracted 2.6 million subscribers, representing 4% of the French market.</p>
